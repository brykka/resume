                  In this position, although I was initially hired as a teacher, I was soon made responsible for program and curriculum development. In addition to daily teaching duties, I assisted in hiring and training new teachers, and created a system for daily evaluations and communications . Another routine  task I enjoyed was designing in-house campaign material.
